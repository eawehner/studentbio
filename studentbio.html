        <p>I am Elizabeth Wehner and this a paragraph that is about me! I am taking a course at UNC Coding Bootcamp to learn Fullstack Development. Exciting! Today we are learning how to use git. I used a photo of my Mom's cat since I didn't have anything other than cats on this computer anyway...</p>
